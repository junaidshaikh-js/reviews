- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- In this project, I learned about showing next or previous reviews when the user click on the next or previous button respectively.

- I also learned about a new CSS property - `object-fit`

  ```css
  .author-image {
    position: relative;
    object-fit: cover;
  }
  ```

  `object-fit` property is used to specify how the image or video should be resized to fit to its container.
